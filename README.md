When sharing a flat with a person and share the various bills To address the challenge of manual expense tracking in a shared living arrangement, I propose the following comprehensive digital solution:

**Implementation of a Robust JSON-Server:**
We will create a JSON server capable of securely storing all expense-related data for future retrieval and reference.

**Automated ID Assignment System:**
Our solution ensures that every input comes with a unique ID, eliminating the need for users to manually insert identification details.

**User-Friendly GUI for Data Display:**
We will design an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to present the stored data effectively, making it easily accessible and visually appealing.

**Intuitive GUI for Streamlined Data Input:**
Our approach involves the development of a user-friendly GUI specifically designed for entering expense details. This will simplify the process of storing data in the server, enhancing overall usability.

**Comprehensive Summary Statistics:**
Our solution includes a feature that generates a comprehensive summary at the end of data retrieval. This summary will highlight total spending, individual expenditures for Person A and Person B, and provide clarity on who owes whom and the respective amounts.

**Enhanced User Experience with React Router DOM:**
Leveraging React Router DOM, we will create a separate view dedicated to the "Add New Item" form. This not only enhances the user experience but also contributes to the overall efficiency of the application.
